			<h1>Rules</h1>
			<br />
      <h2>Categories</h2>
      <p>This edition of the Marathon will have only one category of teams: <i>Remotes</i>. We are
      following the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.</p>
      <p>The Registration in the Marathon is free and mandatory for teams that want to participate
      (see <a href="registration.html">Registration</a>).</p>
      <p>This year, all the following rules apply to all <i>Teams</i>.</p>
			<h2>Teams</h2>
			<p>The Marathon is open to <i>Teams</i> that comprise up to three (3) student members,
      who must be undergraduate or graduate students, and a coach.</p>
      <p>Each Team should use its own PC to test and measure their solutions. Unfortunately, the
      Marathon cannot lend a PC to each competitor or Team.</p>

			<div class="box" align="center">
				<a href="registration.html">Click here to register your team</a>
			</div>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>An independent committee will specify a set of problems. Each one consists of
      an informal explanation of the problem to be solved, the input and output formats,
      and a sequential implementation.</p>

			<div class="box" align="center">
				<a href="problems.html">Click here to get the problem set</a>
			</div>

			<h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Classical HPC libraries and tools (OpenMP, MPI, POSIX Threads) will be provided on the
      target machine.</p>
      <p>An important remark is that speedup is the real target and any technique that can
      accelerate the code will be allowed.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>All <i>Teams</i> will access an Online Contest System: a modified version of <a
      href="http://www.bombonera.org">BOCA</a>. Submissions, clarifications,
      problems or any issue during the contest must be reported through this system.</p>
      <p>Judges will inspect all submissions and any team will be disqualified for any
      unfair and/or fraudulent submission. Also, any suspicious, malicious or plagiarism
      code declassifies the <i>Team</i>.</p>
      <p>A submission is a compressed file with your source code, the <i>Makefile</i>, and
      an execution script. This script must have the name of the problem with capital letters
      (e.g. <i>A</i>). You can submit as many solutions to a problem as you want.</p>

			<h2>Score</h2>
			<p>In order to take a submission into account, its output should be correct, which
      means that it should have the same results compared to sequential outputs.</p>
			<p>The acceleration of each submission will be measured as follows: the execution
      time for a solution will be divided by the execution time for the sequential
      implementation provided by the organization. A solution will be measured three times
      and the meantime will be its final speedup. Any sequential optimization prior to the
      parallelization will be a bonus. The speedup of all problems parallelized by a <i>Team</i>
      will be added, so that the more (efficient) parallel programs it gets, the better
      the score. Only the last submission of a problem will be taken into account for the
      score.</p>
      <p>The following procedure will be used to break standings ties when the difference of two
      final scores is less than 1.0: (i) the number of solved problems that has more
      than 1.5 speedup; (ii) the sum of all submission time used at the score (the smaller the
      better); (iii) the scalability of the solutions on the full target machine (the organizers
      will run and measure all the accepted parallel solutions on the whole target machine).</p>

      <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
      <p>The <i>Organizers</i> reserve the right to cancel, postpone, relocate or change the <i>Remote
      Contest</i> at any time due to unforeseen circumstances, sovereign laws and regulations,
      without notice or compensation. They also cannot assume liability for any changes in
      the program due to external or unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>Only the <i>Organizers</i> will process the data concern to both <i>Contests</i> (registration
      forms, submissions, solutions, source-code, online system information, passwords or any
      other related data). For the purpose of social media, we will be processing your personal
      data, including any additional information you may subsequently provide to us, for the
      purposes of contacting or communicating with you, to respond to your posts, submissions,
      comments, requests, inquiries or complaints, to request feedback from you, assessing your
      application to register for the use or subscription, administer your participation
      in contests, conduct internal activities and any other purposes as may be related to
      the foregoing and/or as set out in the contest websites, e-mail lists and any other
      social media sites.</p>
      <p>Any and all issues with judging and scoring during the Marathon shall be resolved
      solely by the <i>Judges</i> and <i>Committee</i>. <i>Teams</i> may not appeal to any other party. Only the
      <i>Coach</i> can send an issue to the Committee within 24 hours after the end of the contest.</p>
      <p>Should there arise any conflict related to the Marathon, the <i>Committee</i> decision
      shall be considered final and binding.</p>
      <p>The <i>Committee</i> may disqualify a <i>Team</i> in the event of a serious breach of rules or
      fair play.</p>
      <p>Any additional questions that arise will be provided on the Marathon website. If you have
      questions, <a href="local.html">contact the Committee</a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Organizers</i> shall resolve any other unforeseen circumstances and cases.</p>
